# Notes from "Principles of Colour Sensitometry"

## Introduction

The measurement of film must result in the quantitive knowledge of:
- the characteristics of materials in use
- the effects of laboratory handling
- the nature of the photographic images formed
- knowledge sufficiently accurate and comprehensive ensure efficient production 
  of best results

Photographic sensitometry is the science that specifies most of these
measurements and the ways of making them.

The principal concern of photographic sensitometry is the determination of a
quantitive relationship between photographic exposures and the images they
produce. However, it also deals with the entire process from subject to observer. 

- It examines the **kind** and **amount** of radiant energy the film **should**
and **does** receive.
- It tests and controls the sequence of chemical treatments that form in exposed
film.
- It measures the processed images determining the character and contents in
terms of what is most useful for the application.
- Provides means for observers to relate their quality judgements to the
physical characteristics of photographic material.

Colour Sensitometry is used in the motion picture film industry in two broad
fields:
1. Evaluation of techniques and materials
2. The control of the above.

Field one provides straightforward objective descriptions of colour film images
and indirectly describes the characteristics of film and processing operations
or printing systems. It also provides a common language to describe the quality
and performance of those systems. It can be used to compare photographic film
with:

- An ideal
- A practical aim point
- A tolerance limit
- Alternative products (other film stocks etc.)

There are many procedures but the common one is as follows:

1. Exposure imposed on a sample film
2. Sample is processed 
3. Resulting image is processed by some densitometry technique
4. The data is plotted and interpreted
