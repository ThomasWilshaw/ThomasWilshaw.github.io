# On Colour Sensations

## Psychophysical Investigations by G. E. Müller

*This is a translation (so far done via Google Translate and very loosely proof read) of G. E. Müller's* "On Colour Sensations: Psychophysical Investigations" *, published by the German Journal of Psychology and Physiology of the Sensory Organs in 1930. It is a summary of his work on colour perception consisting of over 600 pages split across two volumes.*

*As far as I am aware there is no English translation of this text available anywhere. This is an ongoing project and will take a lot of time. I started with the contents pages of the two volumes, partly to get a sense of what Müller covered and partly so anyone interested can request any specific sections be worked on first (my email/Mastodon account are available on my Github home page). Long term it would be nice to properly digitise/translate the entire book and upload it to the Internet Archive but I don't even know where to begin with that.*

## Preface

After numerous transformations and adaptations to emerging new facts, I have finally brought to a certain conclusion my efforts, originally based on Hering's views and now about 50 years old, to construct the most comprehensive and consistent theory of color perception possible. There is, however, no shortage of so-called theories of color perception. Troland occasionally gives their number as 60. The process of theory formation was usually as follows: The author would have a new idea, or at least one that appeared new to him, concerning the theory of color perception. He would then think of several facts—about 6 to 12, sometimes fewer—from this extraordinarily rich field of phenomena that seemed to agree with the emerging idea, and the theory was complete In contrast to this somewhat childish view of the nature and tasks of scientific theory formation, I present in this work theoretical views which, as the presentation should make clear, are based on a careful theoretical consideration of all the essential results of all relevant experimental investigations available to me and accordingly contribute incomparably more to the explanation of phenomena than the theories put forward thus far. I have, of course, not concealed the facts for whose explanation the theory still requires completion (cf. § 19 and § 34, IV). A general characterization of the presented theory can be found in § 64.

The subject of our investigations is color sensations, insofar as their quality and intensity are concerned. The spatial aspect of these has been disregarded. Furthermore, a discussion of the function of the rod apparatus has been omitted, as I have already dealt with it in detail in a longer treatise (Zeitschr. f. Sinnesphysiol. 54, 1923) and in a section (§§ 13-15) of my book on the types of color blindness. In view of the latter work, I was also able to refrain from a systematic treatment of color blindness, although the views to which a sufficiently thorough study of its various types leads are addressed in this work and even play a fundamental role. A discussion of the influence that attention and perceptual dispositions exert on color sensations was necessary on several occasions. In contrast, a theoretical discussion of the central brightness and color transformations, the doctrine of which is best preserved in the hands of its originator, my colleague D. Katz, has been completely omitted For the sake of brevity, some phenomena of a more peripheral nature, such as the phenomenon of the fusion frequency, which are not essential for psychophysical theory formation, have not been discussed. However, those phenomena that I have addressed due to their theoretical significance, I have endeavored to present and explain as completely as possible, taking full account of the available literature to the extent that it was accessible to me.

When Hering, the founder of the psychophysics of visual sensations and the master of experimental investigation in this field, formulated his theory of opponent colors and the physiological basis of simultaneous contrast, he naturally gave it the form in which it seemed to correspond most simply and elegantly to those phenomena that had aroused his theoretical interest. But the circle of these phenomena was very narrow compared to the totality of facts in this field that are available to us today and require explanation. While in Hering's theory the functioning of the substances mediating the effect of light on the nerve fibers of the eye plays no essential role, we now recognize that numerous interesting phenomena in this field, some even of a dominant nature, can only be explained by referring to the peculiarities of the functioning of those light-sensitive substances. And while Hering, in his work "On the Theory of Light Sense" (p. 118), still expressed the view that the excitation processes of the three specialized optical senses proceeded independently of one another, a large part of the second volume of this work will have to deal with the influences that white light and achromatic optic nerve excitations exert on the chromatic excitation processes

Naturally, the theory to be presented here, through the closer consideration of the functioning of light-sensitive substances and the development of certain ideas about the influence of achromatic processes on chromatic ones, has acquired a considerable complexity, which makes its application somewhat difficult and contradicts the apparently existing prejudice that the theoretical treatment of visual sensations is an activity particularly suitable for dilettantes and beginners. To the objection that our theory is too complicated, I could only say that it is based on ignorance, namely, on a lack of knowledge of the highly complex nature of the extremely rich field of color sensations, which completely precludes for any thinking person the assumption that a theory of the simple character of, for example, Hering's theory could suffice Naturally, I would welcome it as a scientific advance if someone were to prove through action that there is a theory less complicated than ours that nevertheless accomplishes the same in explaining phenomena, or that possesses the same degree of complexity as our theory and at the same time allows for an even more comprehensive explanation of phenomena.

Unfortunately, I have not been able to provide further clarification on some points (e.g., concerning colored fading and Fencher's colors) that have only recently aroused my interest more vividly, through more extensive investigations conducted under my direction, since I have not been the director of the local Psychological Institute for about eight years. Furthermore, the condition of my eyes in recent years has prevented me from carrying out various control observations that I would not have omitted under other circumstances. I have been fortunate enough to be able to compensate for some of these points through the kindness of my colleagues HENNING, JAENSCH, KATZ, KROH, and PFAHLER, who either conducted some of the observations I requested themselves or had them carried out by members of their institutes. I would like to express my gratitude here to them, as well as to Professor ACH, who most readily made the resources of the local Psychological Institute available to me as needed. I also owe a special debt of gratitude to my colleagues KATZ and KELLER for undertaking the considerable effort of proofreading the printed sheets of this work I must also express my particular gratitude for the fact that, as a result of the kind efforts of Professor Boring, to whom I had mentioned the difficulties I was experiencing in obtaining American literature, I received no fewer than approximately 250 reprints of treatises on facial sensations by American psychologists and physiologists. While not all of these treatises, especially those dealing primarily with psychotechnical questions, could be used in the writing of this work, they nevertheless broadened my scientific horizons and reinforced my conviction that limiting oneself to the scientific literature of one's own nation means foregoing a higher level of scientific rigor.

The fairly detailed table of contents provides information about the contents of this volume. The second volume, completed in manuscript and to a large extent already in print, will deal in detail with the aforementioned influences that achromatic processes exert on chromatic ones; furthermore, it will address simultaneous color contrast, the intrinsic brightness of colors, the electrical excitability of the visual organ, the properties of second green, and much more; and finally, it will provide a supplementary overview of the theoretical views presented, in which a position will also be taken on certain views on nerve excitation and its propagation that are widespread in physiological circles.

For the sake of simplifying citations, a number of publications that were repeatedly referenced in various chapters have been briefly listed only by their authors' names. A list of these publications, along with some letter combinations used to cite certain journals or collected works, follows below.

A list of new or specially defined terms used in this work follows at the end of the second volume.
